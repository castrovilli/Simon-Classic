## Simon Classic

A remake of the classic Simon game for the iOS.

Simon Classic is a greatly simplified reinterpretation of the Mac OS X classic [Simon Extreme](http://richd.com/simon/) for the iOS, which in turn is a reinterpretation of the classic 1978 Milton Bradley game [Simon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_%28game%29).
